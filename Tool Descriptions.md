# Tool Descriptions

## Envisioning

### Vision Scope Document

One of the very first items that should be decided upon before embarking on a project is a vision statement.  It is important to be able to rally the team and stakeholders around the common goal of a successful outcome.  Sometimes this may be referred to as a vision and scope document, a project charter or a business case. Regardless of the name the importance of this document is that it helps to define the outcome.  It can also be relied upon in later stages to help test whether new feature requests make sense within the agreed scope of the project.

A good vision document should have a well defined objective.  This ensures that all the stakeholders are on the same page as to what is going to be delivered.  Speaking of which, it should identify the stakeholders – this is anyone that has an interest in the successful outcome of the project – either because they have made an investment of resources or it will have an impact on a business process which they are responsible.

Estimations of time, cost and resources are important to include as well as the key risks.  Udnerstanding these aspects help to address the feasibility while the project is nascient and can ensure that major changes aren’t required in later stages where the opportunity cost is much higher.  Outlining the benefits, especially if they are meant to be measured, is a good practice.  This helps to scope the project allowing feature requests and other changes to verify that the proposed change enhances the expected benefits.  Of course, the success criteria is always important to document from the start.  Projects without a definition of success have a way of lingering on without an explicit closure or dying slow painful death as the scope continues to grow.

The project charter or vision statement, provides input and the basis for other tools/documentation that may follow.  It can be an important baseline for making decisions about how other aspects of the project are decided and implemented.

## Planning

### Requirements Traceability

One way to capture system requirements and track them through the project lifecycle is to do so with a simple spreadsheet.  The template and example here are useful for simple projects and can be customized to fit the project terms.

### Stakeholder Analysis

A stakeholder analysis is a tool often used by a project manager in a more private mode. That is, it is not necessarily something that needs to be collaborated on with the team, but rather a tool that can help a project manager to assess buy-in and help to set priorities.  The purpose of such a tool is to identify key individuals or groups that can influence the project – positively or negatively.  Stakeholders are any that have an interest or influence over the outcome.  So the purpose of this analysis utility is to identify where effort is needed to manage the influence or interest in the project.  This can to be to raise the interest, in order to gain more support or to decrease the influence in order divert unwanted input or distractions.

Stakeholders can be slotted into the appropriate quadrant based on their interest or influence.  Often the management happens by looking at where the stakeholder is on the diagram and comparing it to where you need them or would like them to be.  Once stakeholders can be confidently mapped in the desired quadrant then it becomes more clear how much time and effort is required to interact with the stakeholder

For instance, if the VP of HR has allocated budget for the implementation of a new people management system, then they are likely in the high interest, high power category and should be an important communication priority for the project team.  Meanwhile, a recruiter in HR that takes an interest in how the system will work, but can’t influence the budget might warrant regular updates, but not necessarily in the day-day decision making.  In this scenario, the CIO is also interested in making this project successful and has the power to allocate resources and assign priority to the project – but may not have a high interest in the progress just because it is one of dozens of priorities in the department.

### Risk Register

A risk is the identification of a potential hazzard that may derail the project and put the desired outcome in jeopardy.  Risks come in all different sizes, varying widely in the likelihood and impact.  A few examples of risks include as losing a high-value employee to a competitor before the project is over to a the possibility of a network outage.  The purpose of the risk register is to try to identify all the things that could go wrong, identify the most likely items, develop a plan to avoid the risk (mitigation) and a plan to deal with the failout if the risk comes to pass (contingency).  Not all risks that are identified need to be addressed with a plan, but having identified the risks will allow a team to prioritize which ones are mostly likely or impactful and can ensure a project stays on track and handles hiccups with confidence.

Risks in the example spreadsheet use probablilities as well as impact to determine the highest risk items.  With the impact defined, mitigation plans can be developed as well as contingencies and tracked through the life of project and assigned to an owner who may be responsible for monitoring and reporting on the risk.

### User Story Template

When notecards aren't feasible and you haven't decided on a system to communicate and coordinate user stories amoung your team, a quick and easy spreadsheet can be a good way to capture the stories. The example here allows a structured approach to identifying and sizing stories.
